<p>Hello! Welcome to my Home page site.</P><p>My Username my name is Sebastian105. Don't judge!</p>
<P>one should only be reading this if they are on my replit wtich I will change to a domain, so you wont know where I am storing this.</P>

My name is <strong>Sebastian</strong> and I created this site to make sure my <a href="games.sebastian105.repl.co" target="_blank">games site</a> has a home page.
  <p>If you need any help join the chatroom or put it in the feedback form.</p>
  <p>If the <a href="school.sebastian105.repl.co">original site</a> is blocked than here is the link for the clone ---> <a href="school2.sebastian105.repl.co">here</a></p>
<p>I will probably forget to update the changelog so dont be whine about it.</p>

<p>in order to do this properly make sure you remove the name and stuff and ALWAYS cite me or I will get your a**</p>
<p>Pls note that i will be only updating (looking at feedback/addgame form) every Saterday.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">-How to-</h3>
<p>In order to use this replit you will have to get rid of the window.location.replace or every time you run it it will go back the sebastian105.repl.co</p>
<p>if you make a copy you HAVE TO cite me our I will be pissed.</p>
<p>thats all I have to say.</p>
