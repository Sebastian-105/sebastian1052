<p>Hello! Welcome to my Home page site.</P>
<P>one should only be reading this if they are on my replit wtich I will change to a domain, so you wont know where I am storing this.</P>

My name is <strong>Sebastian</strong> and I created this site to make sure my <a href="games.sebastian105.repl.co" target="_blank">games site</a> has a home page.
  <p>If you need any help join the chatroom or put it in the feedback form.</p>
  <p>If the <a href="school.sebastian105.repl.co">original site</a> is blocked than here is the link for the clone ---> <a href="school2.sebastian105.repl.co">here</a></p>
<p>I will probably forget to update the changelog so dont be whine about it.</p>
<p>If you seen alot of my site you know I like to talk smack about the LPS tech department. I mean what do they do to stop kids, like me, from bypassing them time and time and time and time and time and time (etc) again.</p>

<p>in order to do this properly make sure you remove the name and stuff and ALWAYS cite me or I will get your a**</p>
